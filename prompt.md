Go through the codebase and update the README.md file, also include the tagline of 'Built by Gamers, For Gamers'
----------
create the README file, in such a way that it understandable for every users and gamers, not entirely in the developer perspective
------------------------------------
Check out the main branch and update the changes to that branch and return back to the master branch

I'll help you check out the main branch, update changes there, and return to master. Let me start by checking the current git status.

I want you to create a Design file `/.github/design.md`, detailly explain the design and architecture of this project.
Things to remember,
- Use mermaid code for Architecture diagram
- Highlight / differentiate the important component in the mermaid code (Don't make a cookie cutter diagram)
- Follow the DRY priciple
- It should be tuned for GitHub copilot 


- Don't repeat the same thing again and again.
- Don't sacrifice the content

-The above given structure is only for reference purpose, don't implement as it is (use it as a reference) and stick to our core principles
