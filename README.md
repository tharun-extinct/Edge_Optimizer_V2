## 🎯 Crosshair Setup Guide

### **Requirements:**
- **PNG image** with transparency
- Any size (automatically centered)
- Transparency/alpha channel support

### **Works With:**
✅ Fortnite (Fullscreen mode)  
✅ Valorant  
✅ CS2 (Counter-Strike 2)  
✅ Apex Legends  
✅ Call of Duty  
✅ Rainbow Six Siege  
✅ Most modern games using "Fullscreen" mode

### **How It Works:**
Edge Optimizer uses **Desktop Window Manager (DWM)** technology - the same tech that powers:
- Xbox Game Bar
- Discord overlays
- NVIDIA GeForce Experience
- Steam overlay

### **Fortnite Fullscreen Fix:**
If your crosshair doesn't appear in Fortnite:
1. Navigate to Fortnite installation folder
2. Right-click `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe`
3. Go to **Properties → Compatibility**
4. **UNCHECK** "Disable fullscreen optimizations"
5. Click OK and restart Fortnite

## 🛡️ Safety & Protected Processes

Edge Optimizer **prevents you from killing critical Windows processes** that could crash your system:

🔒 **Protected processes include:**
- `csrss.exe` - Client Server Runtime
- `dwm.exe` - Desktop Window Manager
- `explorer.exe` - Windows Explorer
- `lsass.exe` - Local Security Authority
- `svchost.exe` - Service Host
- `system` - System process
- `winlogon.exe` - Windows Logon

These processes are **automatically blocked** to ensure system stability.

## 📂 Configuration & Files

Edge Optimizer stores all settings in:
```
%APPDATA%\EdgeOptimizer\
├── profiles.json        # Your gaming profiles
└── crosshairs/          # (Optional) Store crosshair images here
```

All configuration is **automatically saved** - no manual file editing required!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Crosshair not appearing over game**
- ✅ Ensure game is in **"Fullscreen"** mode (not "Windowed Fullscreen")
- ✅ Check game exe properties: **uncheck** "Disable fullscreen optimizations"
- ✅ Verify your PNG image has transparency
- ✅ Try activating profile **after** game is running

### **Processes not closing**
- ✅ Verify process names include `.exe` extension
- ✅ Check if process is in the protected list
- ✅ Try running Edge Optimizer as **Administrator**
- ✅ Some processes require special permissions

### **Application won't start**
- ✅ Ensure you have **Visual Studio C++ Redistributables** installed
- ✅ Check Windows Event Viewer for error details
- ✅ Try running as Administrator
- ✅ Verify Windows 10/11 (older versions not supported)

### **Crosshair position is off**
- Use **arrow buttons** (▲▼◀▶) to adjust position
- Click **⊙ button** to reset to screen center
- Changes apply **instantly** - no restart needed
